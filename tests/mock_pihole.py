"""A small in-memory imitation of the Pi-hole v6 REST API.

It implements only what sinko uses, with the same URL shapes, payloads
and quirks as FTL (groups addressed by name, lists by address + ?type=,
domains by /type/kind/domain, PUT keeps groups when "groups" is omitted,
comment is cleared when omitted, etc.).

Beyond the groups/lists/clients API it imitates what the parent page's "My box" sheet needs, with the shapes of FTL's
OpenAPI specs: a password that can be changed (PATCH /api/config with webserver.api.password invalidates every session,
like FTL) or absent ("open" mode), the Teleporter archive (GET and POST /api/teleporter, honouring the "import" JSON),
/api/info/system, sensors, version and host, and GET/PATCH /api/config.

It also serves /pb/box.json the way the box program writes it (`Store.box_info`, `None` = an older box with no such file) and answers
POST /api/action/gravity like FTL: 200 and a text stream first, the run itself after, no matter how it ends.

Test-only switches (set on the Store, no HTTP needed): clock_skew, outage_until, info_fail, max_sessions, totp_code, version,
box_info (the content of /pb/box.json, or None), box_info_age (seconds the file is behind the box's clock), gravity_seconds and
gravity_fail, and `scheduler`, a SchedulerSim that plays the scheduler's side of the request protocol in
docs/maintainers/architecture.md whenever the page writes the pb-state group (so a browser test can watch "Update now" become
running and then ok or failed; a power request that arrives while an update runs is dropped and cleared, as bin/sinko does).
Two more switches play the box's web server and installer for the browser tests of "the page after an update": `static_cache` makes every
page file answer the way Pi-hole's web server (civetweb) does, with `Cache-Control: max-age=3600`, an ETag and 304 for a revalidation, so a
browser keeps old scripts and styles for an hour exactly as it does on a box; `stamp_pages` plays the installer: `@VERSION@` in index.html
becomes the installed version (or a fixed one when `stamp_pages` is a string), and every script says which release it belongs to
(window.__pbAssets). `log_static` keeps the address
(with its query) of every file the page asked for in `static_hits`, so a test can prove from the server's side that a file was fetched again.
`state_read_delay` makes the box slow to answer a read of the shared state (seconds): a test that must hold on a busy machine can run on
a slow box on purpose, instead of hoping the machine is slow enough to show the race.

Run standalone to develop the web page without a Raspberry Pi:
    python3 tests/mock_pihole.py --web web --port 8080   (password: test; --open starts without a password)
