# Sinko — installer and updater.
#
#   curl --proto '=https' --proto-redir '=https' -fsSL https://github.com/iret33/sinko/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sudo bash
#
# Installs Pi-hole v6 (if missing, fully unattended), the parent page, the
# scheduler service and the service block lists. Safe to run again: it then
# updates everything and keeps your password, devices and rules.
#
# By default it downloads the newest release (sinko.tar.gz) from GitHub, checks it
# against the published sha256 and refuses to install it if the two differ.
#
# Optional settings (environment variables, e.g. `curl … | sudo SINKO_HOSTNAME=kids.home bash`).
# What you set once is saved in /etc/sinko/config and kept by later runs and updates (except the password, which only
# Pi-hole keeps).
#   SINKO_PASSWORD        parent password. Otherwise you are asked (or, on a new installation nobody is watching, one is
#                      generated; an update never chooses one). Better not to use it on a shared computer: a command
#                      line with the password in it (also `sudo SINKO_PASSWORD=… bash`: sudo's own arguments) stays in
#                      the shell history and shows in the process list while it runs. The installer removes it from
#                      its own environment at once. How Pi-hole gets it depends on the Pi-hole:
#                        * One that has no password yet (a new installation, a ready-made box nobody has claimed) gets it
#                          through its API, in the body of a request on this machine: never on a command line.
#                        * One that already has a password does not take a new one that way (it refuses configuration
#                          changes from the installer's command-line session), so Pi-hole's own `pihole setpassword` is
#                          used. Pi-hole's program takes a password as an argument and in no other way: for a moment the
#                          password is in that program's arguments, which every local user can read in the process list.
#   SINKO_HOSTNAME        local name for the page, default family.lan ("none" to skip)
#   SINKO_UPSTREAMS       upstream DNS for a NEW Pi-hole, default 1.1.1.3,1.0.0.3
#                      (Cloudflare for Families: also blocks malware and adult sites)
#   SINKO_TIMEZONE        e.g. Asia/Bahrain. Default: Asia/Bahrain if the system is on UTC.
#   SINKO_LISTS_BASE      where Pi-hole downloads the service lists
#   SINKO_REPO_SLUG       the GitHub project as owner/name, default iret33/sinko
#   SINKO_REF             what to install: latest (default) = the newest release,
#                      vX.Y.Z = that release, anything else (a branch such as master)
#                      = developer path: git clone of that branch of SINKO_REPO
#   SINKO_REPO            git URL for the developer path, default https://github.com/<slug>.git
#   SINKO_SRC             a folder with an already extracted release: nothing is downloaded
#                      (used by "sinko update", "sinko rollback", image builds and tests)
#   SINKO_RELEASE_BASE    where releases are downloaded from, default https://github.com/<slug>/releases. https only
#                      (plain http is accepted only for this machine itself). Saved when it is not the default, so
#                      "sinko update" and the update check use it too. SINKO_RELEASE_API (the latest-release
#                      address, default https://api.github.com/repos/<slug>/releases/latest) is kept the same way.
#   SINKO_TELEMETRY       1 = count this box in the anonymous number of Sinko boxes online, 0 = do not (asked: default yes).
#                      Interactive installs ask (default no). Not asked and not set: nothing is saved
#                      and the parent page asks later. What is sent: docs/privacy.md
#   SINKO_MDNS            0 = do not install avahi-daemon (the box answers to <hostname>.local when it is there), and do
#                      not announce the box to the Sinko app (Bonjour, _sinko._tcp)
#   SINKO_OS_UPDATES      0 = do not set up automatic Debian security updates (never a restart; left alone when
#                      unattended-upgrades is already installed)
#   SINKO_NONINTERACTIVE  1 = never prompt
#
# Exit status: 0 = done, 1 = failed (the log says why), 75 = not enough free disk space (nothing was changed: "sinko update"
# can report that as a disk problem and not as a failed update).

# Pi-hole's FTL refuses every configuration change from a command-line session, which is the only kind of session this

# modify Pi-hole config settings" (HTTP 403, src/api/config.c in FTL's source). So there is no sign-in here at all. The
# other way, `pihole-FTL --config webserver.api.password <pw>` and `pihole setpassword <pw>` (which ends in that same
# command), takes the password as an argument, and every local user can read a running program's arguments in
# /proc/<pid>/cmdline: that is the fallback, and the only way for a Pi-hole that already has a password.
