# First start of a ready-made Sinko box: make the things that must be unique to this box its own.
# Run by sinko-firstboot.service, which only starts while /var/lib/sinko/firstboot exists (tools/seal.sh puts it there).
#
#   1. new SSH host keys            (the golden unit's keys are on every card that was flashed from its image)
#   2. the host name, and with it the <name>.local that avahi announces
#   3. new ids                      (no stale install-id: the anonymous counter's random number must not be shared between
#                                    boxes; and a box id of its own, which box.json shows the app, written at once)
#   4. Pi-hole's own HTTPS key      (the seal removed the golden unit's; Pi-hole's FTL makes a new one when it starts
#                                    without: this waits until the file is there, and restarts FTL once if it is not)
#   5. the box's address for THIS network: "sinko configure --ip <address> --hostname <name>" and SINKO_IP
#
# Steps 1-4 need nothing from the network and are done first. The flag is removed when all of it worked. When the network
# is not up yet (cable not plugged in, router slow), or Pi-hole is not ready for step 5, the script ends well and leaves
# the flag, so the next start tries again (nothing already done is done twice: the flag remembers the keys and the id).
# After three starts without an address it lets go: the scheduler's address watch (every 5 minutes) sets the address as
# soon as there is one, and a flag that stays would hold back SSH and the scheduler at every start.
#
# It is meant to be quick: it waits only for what it needs (a cable that is not there, a key that FTL has not written yet),
# and it never restarts Pi-hole when the key is already there. Until a parent has chosen a password on the welcome screen,
# anybody on the home network could do it first: the shorter the start, the shorter that time.
