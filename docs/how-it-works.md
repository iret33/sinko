## The pieces

```
Parent's phone ──► http://box/  (index.html + /pb/app.js)
                        │  Pi-hole REST API (/api), signed in with the parent password
                        ▼
                  Pi-hole FTL  ◄──── sinko.service (timers, bedtime)
                        │
Child's device ──DNS──► │  blocked if the device is in an enabled pb-* group
```

- Every service has its own Pi-hole group `pb-svc-<id>` that owns one block
  list. Lists are **always enabled** (Pi-hole leaves disabled lists out when it
  rebuilds), and a service is blocked by **enabling its group**. Changes apply
  immediately, and after every change the box's DNS cache is cleared (a quick resolver restart,
  `POST /api/action/restartdns`): Pi-hole keeps answers it learned before a block and would otherwise keep serving them,
  so a freshly blocked app could keep working for a while. A device's own cache and apps that are already open can
  still take a few minutes.
- Child devices are clients that belong to `pb-kids`, `pb-guard` (blocks
  outside DNS-over-HTTPS resolvers), `pb-offline` and every `pb-svc-*` group.
  Pausing a device adds it to `pb-paused`.
- `pb-offline` and `pb-paused` share one "block everything" rule, so
  "internet off" only affects children's devices, never the parents'.
- Timer and bedtime settings are stored as JSON in the description of the
  disabled group `pb-state`. The page writes them; `sinko run`
  (a systemd service) enforces them every 15 seconds.
- *What Sinko did for you* (the card with ads stopped, app tries, nights kept and time off): every 15 minutes the
  scheduler counts, read-only, what Pi-hole's long-term database says was stopped and by which list (FTL notes it as
  `list_id`), and it notes itself how long the children's internet was off and whether bedtime was kept. Counts only,
  kept in `/var/lib/sinko/savings.json` (days for 35 days, running totals after that), and copied for the page into the
  description of the disabled group `pb-ledger` at most once an hour, so only a signed-in parent can read it. The details
  are in [`architecture.md`](maintainers/architecture.md#savings-ledger-pb-ledger).
- Devices are added by MAC address when Pi-hole knows it (stable across IP
  changes), otherwise by IP address. An IPv6-only entry is not offered, because
  phones rotate their IPv6 privacy addresses every day.
- **Which rule applies to a device.** Pi-hole takes a device's groups from the
  first of these that matches: a client row for its IP address or a subnet (the
  longest match wins), then its MAC address, then its host name. So an IP or
  subnet row, for example `192.168.1.0/24` added in the Pi-hole admin, silently
  overrides a child's MAC row, and none of the child's rules apply. `doctor`,
  `status` (`shadowed_by`) and the page warn about this. Remove such a row, or give
  a row that covers only that one device the same groups. Matching by MAC also needs
  Pi-hole's `resolver.macNames` setting to stay on (it is on by default).

Everything Sinko creates in Pi-hole starts with `pb-` or has a comment starting with `pb:`, and your own groups, lists, clients
and rules are never touched. (`pb-` is an internal prefix kept from earlier versions; it is not the product name.) One
exception follows from how Pi-hole works: it allows only one deny rule per pattern. If you already have your own `^.*$`
rule, Sinko adds its two groups to it and leaves everything else about it alone, and never deletes it; while "internet
off" or "pause" is on, whatever your own rule allows still resolves.

## The live picture

The card under the big button draws what Pi-hole is doing, in words a parent can follow:
devices on top, the family box in the middle, the internet at the bottom. A request
goes to the box; a stopped one comes back as a dead end (a red packet with a cross), an
allowed one goes on to the internet and back (a teal packet with a tick), and one the box
remembered turns around at the box. A dotted line around the box shows that after a yes the
device connects by itself: videos and messages never pass through the box.
*Show me how it works* plays a five-step tour with clearly labelled **Example** packets from
an example phone; examples never change a number. *More detail* explains the four steps,
shows busy hours, the apps stopped most, and explains the technical words (DNS, gravity, cache).

What it reads, and how often: `/api/stats/summary` every 15 s (the three numbers: checked,
stopped, share; *whole home, last 24 hours*), `/api/queries` every 3.5 s with a small `length` and
`from` taken from the box's own clock, and `/api/history` plus `/api/stats/top_domains` only while the
detail sheet is open. Nothing is read while the page is hidden, a dialog is open, or the picture is folded
away (the chevron remembers its state). At most about 3 packets a second are drawn; the rest are only counted.
The picture never changes a rule.

- **Names.** An app is named only when its domain is in `pb/domains.json` (made at install time from the
  block lists, `sinko domain-map`); anything else is "A website". Raw domain names are never shown.
  A *stop* is credited to an app only when that app is blocked for the child it came from: an ad list also
  stops trackers on an allowed app's domain, and that reads "An unwanted site", never "Stopped Netflix". While the
  internet is off or a device is paused, a stop says that instead. A device is named for a stop only, never for an allowed lookup.
- **Each child's wire** shows what is true: *Online now*, *Quiet*, *Paused*, *Internet off*, *Rules may
  not apply* (another Pi-hole client row overrides the child's, see above), *Not seen in 24 hours*
  (the device is probably not using the box) and *Rules set* (the box cannot tell when it was last online, for
  example at a privacy level that hides devices: never a guess like "not seen"). The headline says "the rules are working"
  only when nothing needs a look and a device was seen lately; if every device is quiet, or one has been quiet for
  hours (a phone that left Wi-Fi looks exactly like that), it says "the rules are set". If Pi-hole's blocking is switched off
  (`/api/dns/blocking`), the card says so in amber instead of anything green.
- **Privacy levels.** At level 1 packets are drawn without app names, at level 2 clients are folded into
  "Whole home", at level 3 only the totals are shown, with a note saying why.
- **Reduced motion.** Nothing moves; the "What just happened" list opens by default and a short summary is
  announced to screen readers at most every 30 seconds.
- Arabic is drawn right to left with the whole picture mirrored; digits stay Latin.

## Block lists

`lists/` holds one list per service (Adblock style, `||domain^` per line) plus
`guard.txt`. `lists/services.json` is the catalog shown on the page.

Pi-hole downloads the lists straight from this repository, so a change pushed
to `master` reaches every box on its next nightly refresh (or immediately with
`sudo pihole -g`). Adding a **new** service also needs the new code on the box:
`sudo sinko update`. Pi-hole's gravity (`pihole -g`) has no lock of its own and two runs at once leave lists missing or
doubled, so every run that Sinko starts (its setup, the installer's, the nightly timer) takes one lock and waits its turn;
a run you start by hand with `sudo pihole -g`, Pi-hole's own weekly run and the page's restore do not take it, so avoid
starting one while an update is running.

To add a service: create `lists/<id>.txt`, add an entry to `services.json`
(id, English and Arabic names, category, colour, whether Homework mode blocks
it), and run the tests. The tests refuse lists that would block shared
infrastructure such as `google.com`, `apple.com` or `akamaihd.net`.

The lists are public domain (CC0), so you may subscribe any Pi-hole to them directly. A box downloads them from
`SINKO_LISTS_BASE` (by default this repository's `lists/` on GitHub, branch `master`), which is separate from the release a
box runs: list fixes reach boxes without a new release, and a box can be pointed at your own copy.

## Files on the box

| Services | `sinko.service` (scheduler), `sinko-lists.timer` (nightly list refresh), `sinko-firstboot.service` (ready-made boxes only) |
| The announcement for the Sinko app | `/etc/avahi/services/sinko.service` (Bonjour, `_sinko._tcp`; not with `SINKO_MDNS=0`) |
