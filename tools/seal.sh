# Seal a "golden unit" before its SD card is copied to an image that is flashed onto many boxes.
#
#   sudo /opt/sinko/tools/seal.sh --dry-run     shows everything it would do and changes nothing
#   sudo /opt/sinko/tools/seal.sh               shows it, then asks you to type SEAL
#
# Sealing removes what must be unique to each box or private to the seller (SSH host keys, machine id, the counter's
# install id, the box's own id that box.json shows the app, query history, the parent password, two-factor secret and
# application password so the page shows its welcome screen, Pi-hole's own HTTPS key, Pi-hole's saved older settings and
# databases, the children's devices and timers, saved Wi-Fi networks, shell history, logs), turns off Armbian's automatic
# root login on the console, arms sinko-firstboot.service, which gives every box its own keys, name and address when it
# first starts, and, as the very last step, locks the root password and the password logins over SSH. Then it writes zeros
# over the free space, because deleting a file only frees its blocks. Power the unit off right after sealing and do not
# start it again before you copy the card: starting it uses up the seal.
#
# It first checks that the unit has what the customer's first minutes and years depend on (avahi-daemon so that sinko.local
# works, an address from the router, the services enabled, Debian's automatic security updates, a time service, and no
# account other than root that can log in on the console) and refuses to seal otherwise.
#
# Options:
#   --yes               do not ask for SEAL (for scripts)
#   --dry-run           only show what would be done (and what is wrong with this unit)
#   --keep-ssh-access   leave the root password, SSH password logins and the authorized keys alone (a test unit)
#   --hostname NAME     the name of every box, so that http://NAME.local/ opens the page (default: sinko)
#   --no-zerofill       do NOT overwrite the free space (a test unit only: what was deleted can then be read from the
#                       image with ordinary undelete tools; zeros are the default, --zerofill is accepted and does nothing)
#   --skip-checks       do not check that the unit is ready (a test unit only)
#
# Pi-hole's own groups, lists and clients are never touched, only Sinko's (names starting with pb-), through the sinko
# program. The Pi-hole files deleted directly, while Pi-hole's FTL is stopped: the query history (and its temporary
# copy), the HTTPS key and certificates, the saved older settings (config_backups) and the older gravity databases.

# The Allwinner watchdog (sunxi_wdt, the H616/H618 of the Orange Pi Zero 3 included) takes 1 to 16 seconds at most: a larger
# value is refused by the driver, and systemd then runs without the safety net it was asked for. So both values are 15 seconds.
# What systemd does with them (read in its source, src/core/main.c and src/shutdown/shutdown.c, which are the same in systemd
# 252 of Debian 12 and 257 of Debian 13):
#   * RuntimeWatchdogSec: while the system runs, PID 1 feeds the watchdog at least every half interval, and a box that hangs
#     for 15 seconds is reset by the hardware. That is what the setting is for. It also holds in the first phase of a shutdown
#     or reboot, while PID 1 still runs.
#   * poweroff and halt (the page's "Shut down"): PID 1 closes the watchdog AND DISARMS it (WDIOS_DISABLECARD and the magic
#     close) before it hands over to systemd-shutdown, and tells that program that there is no watchdog (WATCHDOG_USEC=0): only
#     reboot and kexec carry a watchdog time over. So the watchdog cannot turn a shut down into a restart, however the board's
#     power-off ends. This relies on the driver letting it be stopped: sunxi_wdt does, unless the kernel was built with
#     CONFIG_WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT, which only the board can show (docs/hardware-test-checklist.md: "Shut down stays off").
#   * reboot: RebootWatchdogSec is the safety net of the reboot itself. The watchdog stays armed with that time through
#     systemd-shutdown, which feeds it only at the start of each unmount pass: not during its first sync (it waits as long as the
#     amount of unwritten data keeps shrinking) and not while it ends stray processes. A stall of more than 15 seconds there
#     resets the box in the middle of the shutdown; the file system is recovered from its journal at the next start. That is
#     the price of a net that also catches a reboot that hangs, and 15 seconds is all this driver allows (RebootWatchdogSec=off
#     would take away both the price and the net).
# "ShutdownWatchdogSec" is an obsolete name of RebootWatchdogSec, not another setting: it does not apply to poweroff either.
