"""The real parent page and the real scheduler, talking to each other through Pi-hole's pb-state group.

The page (web/) was tested against an imitation of the scheduler (SchedulerSim in tests/mock_pihole.py) and the scheduler
(Controller, Maintenance, Scheduler in bin/sinko) against states written by hand. Nothing tested the protocol BETWEEN the two
real programs (docs/maintainers/architecture.md, "Shared state"). Here Chromium drives the real page against the mock
Pi-hole while the real scheduler code ticks against the same state:

  * the scheduler is `pb.Scheduler.step()`: the real Controller.tick and the real Maintenance.run, logged in to the mock
    through SINKO_API_URL, keeping its files in a temporary SINKO_STATE_DIR. Only what would touch the machine is a
    recording fake, through the hooks Maintenance already has: the update runner, the power command, the address change,
    the repair and the post-crash check. The update check is the REAL check against a fake GitHub, the counter pings and
    forget requests are the REAL ones against the fake counter service, and box.json is written by the REAL writer;
  * time: the scheduler's passes use the real wall clock (the page compares update.at and box.json's `at` with the box's
    clock), while the timers of Maintenance (first check after 2 minutes, first ping after 5 ...) count a clock the test
    moves forward;
  * nobody ticks in the background. A test acts in the page, waits until the page's write has reached Pi-hole, and then
    lets the scheduler run a pass, so each step is deterministic. (The page and the scheduler both read, change and write
    the whole description; Pi-hole has no compare-and-swap, so two writes that truly overlap can lose one. That is a known
    limit of the protocol, not something a deterministic test can show, and no test here pretends otherwise.)
